Bash and Bioinformatics Basics

This project is part of the Stage 0 training tasks. It focuses on learning basic command-line operations, file handling, and installing essential bioinformatics tools. The project is divided into two parts:

Project 1: Bash Basics

In this part, I practiced using the command line to:

Print text to the terminal

Create and navigate directories

Download and manage files (.fna and .gbk)

Detect whether a DNA sequence is wild-type or mutant by searching for specific motifs (tata vs tatatata)

Extract useful biological information from .gbk files (sequence length, source organism, gene names)

Clean the terminal and review command history

Organize files into folders

Project 2: Installing Bioinformatics Software

In this part, I practiced setting up a conda environment and installing commonly used bioinformatics tools through the bioconda channel, including:

Figlet

BWA

BLAST

Samtools

Bedtools

SPAdes

Bcftools

Fastp

MultiQC

Each step was carried out directly on the terminal, and the exact commands used are documented in the scripts.
